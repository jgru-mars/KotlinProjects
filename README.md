# Josiah's Kotlin Project

# Console Based Project
The author of this code is Josiah Groux
This program is made in Kotlin and will ask the user to enter the names of countries in Europe. It only accepts answers
that are the correct name with the first letter capitalized. If anything else is entered, it will have the user try again.
The program continues until the user can not enter any more countries, then they can exit the program. Right before the
program closes, it will proceed to print out the list of countries that the user did get correct.
